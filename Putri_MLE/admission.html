                <p>SNMPTN is the path that students will be able to follow for the first time. This pathway allows students to enter PTN without having to take a written exam.</p>
                <p>The trick is to take into account the value of report cards or achievements during school including non-academic ones as the entrance exam test scores.</p>
                <p> The majors that can be chosen are a maximum of two study programs from one PTN or two PTN. If you choose two study programs, one of the selected PTN must be in the same area as the school. If you choose only one study program, you can choose a PTN located in any city.</p>
                <p>The quota given for the SNMPTN pathway in 2021 is a minimum of 20% of the total quota per university. Specially, students can also choose S1 and D4 majors at several state polytechnics.</p>

                <p>This SBMPTN is a pathway that requires you to take a written test. Later, it is the grades and effort in doing the exam that will determine. Here, school accreditation and achievements during school are not taken</p>
                <p>The stages that need attention to be able to take part in the SBMPTN are when students register, students also directly choose the study program and PTN they want. Because students have not taken the exam, students also do not know the total score for their UTBK.</p>
                <p> This is different from the 2019 SBMPTN, where if students have taken the exam and know the UTBK test scores, then they choose a study program and PTN. In addition, if previously allowed to take the exam up to two times, the 2021 SBMPTN can only be once.’</p>

                    <p> The independent path is the last option if it is not accepted through the SNMPTN and SBMPTN channels. Please note that the independent path has different regulations depending on each campus. </p>
                    <p>This is because the independent path is managed by each campus, no longer by the government. For example, there are a number of campuses that can use the SBMPTN score as a benchmark for graduation, while a number of campuses must take the written test again. </p>
                    <p>Besides that, usually the independent path charges a starting fee for prospective students. In addition, PTNs tend to charge UKT to the high class for independent pathways. </p>
